todo:

- In a monki.l file, check whether the repository url of a clone
  operation has changed.  If so, rm -rf the subtree's .monki dir.

- Embed monki's current version into a monki.l file.  Have monki
  sync itself to that version while processing a monki.l file.
  
  - Note: Handle security fixes properly, i.e. refuse to sync to a
    vulnerable version of Monki.
