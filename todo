todo:

- Abort on errors.
- Add a `monki update` command that causes monki to update itself.
- Rename `monki clone` to `monki cp`?
- Alias `monki` to `ki` via a symlink.
- Add a `monki install` command that symlinks bin/monki to ~/bin.
- When processing a monki.l file, check whether the repository url of
  a clone operation has changed, and rm -rf the subtree's .monki dir.
- When cloning from a local git repo, e.g. `monki clone ../foo foo`,
  automatically try to use ../foo/.git or ../foo/.monki/git/.git.
- Embed monki's current version into a monki.l file.  Have monki
  sync itself to that version while processing a monki.l file.
  - Note: Handle security fixes properly, i.e. refuse to sync to a
    vulnerable version of Monki.
- Fix (shell cmd) to print to stdout rather than always capture
  stdout.
- Fix writefile to preserve chmod flags of the target file.
